# Sorting Algorithms
## This repository consists of different sorting algorithms using Python


|  Algorithm |Description| Worst Case  | Best Case | Average Case  |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Bubble Sort | Compares all the element one by one and sort them based on their values | O(n^2)  | O(n) / O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| Selection Sort | Get the minimum value of unsorted array and swap value to the front. Divides the array into two parts. Sorted and unsorted. | O(n^2) | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| Insertion Sort | Divide into 2 parts. Sorted and unsorted. Every iteration will remove an element from unsorted part and insert  into sorted part with the correct position. | O(n^2) | O(n)| O(n^2) |
| Merge Sort | Break list into halves and merge the smaller halves, and merge them back together. Divide and conquer using recursive function | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) |
| Quick Sort | Uses a partition and pivot points. Divide and conquer with recursive function | O(n^2) | O(nlog(n)) | O(nlog(n)) |
